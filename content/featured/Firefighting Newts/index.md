Firefighting Newts is an iOS/Android application developed in Unity Game Engine. FF Newts is a first-person game where the player is a newt. The newt spits out streams of water in order to extinguish fires in a burning city. The objective of the game is to gain as many points as possible, by putting out fires, before time runs out.
